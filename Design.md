# This is the design document for my Mobile App Project

## So what is this project about

This project displays the weather in the users location using the open weather api. The app will use the device's GPS to get the users location . It will then display it in a forecast. The user will also have the ability to search for a city/ area and have the weather displayed for the city or area they searched.

## Project Breakdown

### Images[Insert mockup here]

### Coding

The app will be created using xamarin forms. I will use visual studio for mac however a uwp version can be built when the project is imported into visual studio for windows as the code is the same for app the platforms.

### How to run

This project needs visual studio to run. Windows seems to constantly need updates etc to get it to run for UWP. It works out of the box for andrioid and IOS. I have tested on both android and IOS device's. Unless you have a mac it will not build for IOS when you import to visual studio. I may put it on the app store if i can. Link here ==>
