# Mobile App Dev project

## Getting Started
Need visual studio to run this app

## What does it do?
It uses the open weather api to retrieve the weather for a location the user
enteres. It also has the ability to retrive the data based on the users
location. It only works if you agree for the app to view your location

I did a git push -u origin master -- force and it has overwritten my commits
